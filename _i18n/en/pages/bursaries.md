Conference sponsors make it possible and they offer grants, so that more people can participate. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, as individual or institution, send us and email to [hdlabconicet@gmail.com](mailto:hdlabconicet@gmail.com). 

## Bursaries 

### TEI / MEI Travel Grants

Organising and sponsoring institutions and groups offer bursaries to cover travel and participation costs. All authors of accepted papers are elegible to apply for one of these bursaries. Applications will be received after the acceptance notification through an online form. The selection of the receivers will be performed by the Programme Committee based on the needs and qualifications of the applicants, as well as the quality of the abstract submitted to the conference. 

The [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) is offering **one bursary of 1,000 USD** and the [MEI](https://music-encoding.org/) is offering **two bursaries of 500 USD each**.

### Inscription Waver Grant

Thanks to individual sponsors we are able to offer bursaries that cover the cost of inscription to the conference for participants from Latin America and Argentina. Anyone who aims at actively participating in the conference can apply (not only presenters). Applications will be received through an online form that will be made available in due time. The selection of the receivers will be performed by the Programme Committee based on the applications presented.
