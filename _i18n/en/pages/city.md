# Buenos Aires (BA) City - Info for visitors 

**Money**: The Argentine currency is the Peso. Cash is available in notes ($ 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000). Credit and Debit cards are widely accepted in stores, restaurants, etc. The most accepted cards are Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.<br>
Argentina is experiencing hyperinflation. You might want to bring USD cash and exchange this to Argentine Pesos in the hotel or locally. Argentina has an “official exchange rate” and an unregulated one called “blue” that might offer a better rate than the official (the gap is almost 100%). Do not change your money on the streets – it is a common scam. Instead, ask your local host to change your money. Exchange houses use the official exchange rate.<br>
ATMs, known as ‘Cajeros Automáticos’, are available in Buenos Aires to withdraw cash against a credit card. It might include an extra charge for withdrawing money from foreign accounts.<br>

Using your common sense is good advice anywhere.<br>
 
Please take this advice during your visit:<br>
 

In bars and restaurants don’t leave your phone lying on the table, especially if you’re on the sidewalk. Don’t leave your purse hanging from the back of the chair, it’s better to hang it from the little hooks under the table or leave it on your lap.<br>
Although the La Boca and San Telmo neighborhoods are well-known tourist destinations, they are notoriously dangerous if you stray from the main tourist avenues, check with your local host before sightseeing alone and ask for recommendations. There have been violent robberies in the daytime as well as nighttime. Stay on the main streets in the tourist zone and use radio taxis/UBERs to and from the neighborhood.<br>
Scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. Pre-arrange a ride or select one of the flat-rate “remise” services (private car with driver) from the airport.

Public transportation is largely safe to use. You’ll need to be wary of pickpockets, especially during crowded peak hours. Recommendations include: Wear your purse across your body, do not use your phone, it can get snatched. Only carry your essentials, leave important documents such as your passport at the Apartments.<br>
