# Info for visitors 

**Money**: The Argentine currency is the Peso. Cash is available in notes ($ 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000). Credit and Debit cards are widely accepted in stores, restaurants, etc. The most accepted cards are Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.<br>
Argentina is experiencing hyperinflation. You might want to bring USD cash and exchange this to Argentine Pesos in the hotel or locally. Argentina has an “official exchange rate” and an unregulated one called “blue” that might offer a better rate than the official (the gap is almost 100%). Do not change your money on the streets – it is a common scam. Instead, ask your local host to change your money. Exchange houses use the official exchange rate.<br>
ATMs, known as ‘Cajeros Automáticos’, are available in Buenos Aires to withdraw cash against a credit card. It might include an extra charge for withdrawing money from foreign accounts.<br>
**Banking & Shopping Hours**: Banks are regularly open from Monday to Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Stores are open from Mondays to Fridays from 9:00 a.m. (some 9:30 or 10:00) to 8:00 p.m., and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Shopping malls open every day from 10:00 a.m. to 9 p.m.<br>
**Access to internet**: There is public wifi in many parts of Buenos Aires, provided for free by the Buenos Aires City Government. You can also use mobile data. If your mobile provider does not already allow you to roam in Argentina, some advice from travel blogs is to buy a prepaid SIM (or “chip”) directly from one of the Argentinian mobile providers (Claro, Personal, Movistar) either in-store (you’ll need your passport for activation!) or online in advance.  <br>

***Getting around in Buenos Aires***<br>

**Transfer from Ezeiza National Airport**: there are many taxi and transportation services that you can hire at the airport. Most of the time, you pay a fixed price before taking the ride. It’s advisable to book your taxi in advance using Tienda Leon, which offers door-to-door service and transport to and from the airport. At Ezeiza airport we recommend the service **On Baires transfer**. You will find their window at the left, before exiting. Their WhatsApp for reservations is: +5491123386874**<br>
While Uber is available in Argentina, “CABIFY” works much better and it is not very expensive: download the app. It works the same way as Uber, you can pay by credit card or cash.<br>

**Bus**: They run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and cover the whole city. Tell the bus driver where you are headed (give the name of the crossroad nearest to where you wish to get off) and he will select the correct fare. The “Metro Bus” is a bus rapid transit system using dedicated bus lanes to cut journey times on several of the city’s main arteries. Several Metrobus stops have free WiFi access. You can find information about when buses or subways are arriving and how to get to any place using google maps or Moovit.<br>
 
**SUBE card**: to take any bus or metro train, you must pay with a SUBE card, which is a rechargeable magnetic card that allows payment for the different means of public transportation in Buenos Aires; you can charge it with credit in the metro station or in most drugstores.<br>

***Safety tips***<br>

**Useful phone numbers**: For any criminal episode: 911. If you can’t communicate in Spanish, you can ask for the “tourist police” once an officer picks up the phone.<br>
For medical emergencies: 107. If provided, you can also call the emergency number of your travel insurance. Universal Assistance and AssistCard are the most popular in Argentina.<br>
 
**Tips for staying safe**: We suggest that you always keep your belongings close to you, use authorized taxis, and make sure that your bags or backpacks are securely closed. It’s advisable to stay on well-lit streets during nighttime and avoid wearing flashy jewelry or expensive accessories. Do not use your phone on the streets. In case of an emergency, dial 911.<br>
 
**General advice on food & drink**: Fruits and vegetables are safe to eat. Milk and butter are pasteurized. Argentine beef and wine are the two musts when visiting Argentina.
