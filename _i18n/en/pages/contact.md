# Sponsorship Opportunities

 Get in touch at [hdlabconicet@gmail.com](mailto:hdlabconicet@gmail.com) to find out more about the sponsorship options available. 

Our default sponsorship packages include: 

- Virtual Sponsor: Logo on the TEI 2024 sponsors web page (linking to your website)  and opening conference slide, mentioned in thank-you speech at opening keynote.
- Reception Sponsor: All of the above, plus announced special thanks at the start of one of the receptions, a tweet from the @TEI twitter account thanking the sponsor on the day of that reception.

Other sponsorship opportunities can be negotiated directly, and individual items (such as full/half-page adverts in the PDF book of abstracts) are also available.
