# Buenos Aires (BA) City - Info for visitors 

## Money

The Argentine currency is the Peso ($; with 100 centavos in each peso). Cash is available in notes ($ 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000). Credit and Debit cards are widely accepted in stores, restaurants, etc. The most accepted cards are Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.
Argentina is experiencing hyperinflation. You might want to bring USD cash and exchange this to Argentine Pesos in the hotel or locally. Argentina has an “official exchange rate” and an unregulated one called “blue” that might offer a better rate than the official (the gap is almost 100%). Do not change your money on the streets – it is a common scam. Instead, ask your local host to change your money. Exchange houses use the official exchange rate.
ATMs, known as ‘Cajeros Automáticos’, are available in Buenos Aires and a few other major cities to withdraw cash against a credit card. It might include an extra charge for withdrawing money from foreign accounts.
Banking & Shopping Hours: Banks are regularly open from Monday to Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Stores are open from Mondays to Fridays from 9:00 a.m. (some 9:30 or 10:00) to 8:00 p.m., and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Shopping malls open every day from 10:00 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Access to internet
There is public wifi in many parts of Buenos Aires, provided for free by the Buenos Aires City Government. You can also use mobile data. If your mobile provider does not already allow you to roam in Argentina, some advice from travel blogs is to buy a prepaid SIM (or “chip”) directly from one of the Argentinian mobile providers (Claro, Personal, Movistar) either in-store (you’ll need your passport for activation!) or online in advance.  
Getting around in Buenos Aires
Transfer from Ezeiza National Airport: there are many taxi and transportation services that you can hire at the airport. Most of the time, you pay a fixed price before taking the ride. It’s advisable to book your taxi in advance using Tienda Leon, which offers door-to-door service and transport to and from the airport
 
Subte (Underground train network): is the quickest way to get around in Buenos Aires. There are six lines (A, B, C, D, E and H) that connect the city’s main avenues. The B line takes you to Novotel, where the conference will take place. You have to hop off at Callao or Uruguay stations and walk a couple of blocks.
 
Bus: They run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and cover the whole city. Tell the bus driver where you are headed (give the name of the crossroad nearest to where you wish to get off) and he will select the correct fare. The “Metro Bus” is a bus rapid transit system using dedicated bus lanes to cut journey times on several of the city’s main arteries. Several Metrobus stops have free WiFi access.
 
You can find information about when buses or subways are arriving and how to get to any place using google maps or Moovit: Search for any destination and get turn-by-turn directions; very useful for public transportation (Bus, train and metro).
 
SUBE card: to take any bus or metro train, you must pay with a SUBE card, which is a rechargeable magnetic card that allows payment for the different means of public transportation in Buenos Aires; you can charge it with credit in the metro station or in most drugstores (you can only charge your card with Argentinian pesos, and the fee for each ride is approximately ARS$50). Here’s a map of all the locations where you can buy your SUBE card.
 
For car rides: While Uber is available in Argentina, the service isn’t actually legal, and therefore, it has no legal or security control. You can use “CABIFY” instead: download the app, it works the same way as Uber, and cash payments are recommended.
